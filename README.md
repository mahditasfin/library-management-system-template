# library-management-system-template

## Library Management System
In this assignment, you will build a simple library management system using Java. The system will allow users to view all books in the library's inventory, search for a book by title, author, or ISBN, check out a book to a patron, return a book that was previously checked out, and add a new book to the library's inventory.

## Usage
* View all books
* Search for a book
* Check out a book
* Return a book
* Add a new book
* Quit

## Requirements
To complete this assignment, you will need to create the following classes:

`Book`: A class representing a book with fields for title, author, ISBN, checked out status, and patron name.
`Library`: A class representing the library with a list of books in its inventory and methods for viewing all books, searching for a book, checking out a book, returning a book, and adding a new book to the inventory.
`UserInterface`: A class for handling user input and displaying output to the console.
You will also need to create a pom.xml file for building the project with Maven.

Getting Started
* Clone the repository from GitHub.
* Create a new Maven project in your preferred IDE.
* Implement the Book, Library, and UserInterface classes.
* Test your implementation by running the App class.
